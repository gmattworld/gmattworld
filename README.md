I'm an Enterprise-Level Fullstack Developer with over 5+ years of experience in Technology and a track record in Web & Mobile Engineering.

I implement key software development principles [like SOLID, DRY, Clean Code...] and design patterns [like IRepository pattern, Unit of work, Singleton...] to improve execution speed, quality of code and significantly reduce debugging processes.

I create human-centred web and mobile solutions that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. I work to make a more solid modern web; one that is fast, easy to use, elegant, accessible to all, and frustration-free.

My career goal is to bring individual and business ideas to reality through what I know how to do best. With this, I wake up each day thinking about how I can make the world around me better.
